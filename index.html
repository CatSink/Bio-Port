      <h2>About Me:</h2>
       <p>
         I own a home in Columbus, Ohio which provides me with a lot of freedom and DIY projects. My favorite local coffee shop is One Line Coffee. 
         I like to spend time outdoors hiking at parks, cycling around the Columbus area, and I am a garden enthusiast. 
         My cat, Persephone, is my at home companion. She loves to fetch and play.
         Artistic expression is one of my preferred ways to relax. I enjoy knitting hats and gloves and have explored pit firing small clay sculptures.
         Checking out a new series from a streaming service, or jumping into an alternative universe in a gaming console 
         are some other ways I like to spend my free-time.

      <h3>My Work:</h3>
        <p>
          I recently began my journey into learning web development.
          I am currently building my knowledge and skills in HTML and CSS styling.
          The world-wide wed is exciting and overwhelming with the amount of possibilities.
          I am looking forward to linking live webpages for potential employer's 
          to review in the near future!
          This page represents some of the skills I will learn throughout the course of 
           a coding bootcamp.As of now my expeiences are limited to HTML and CSS 
           with a basic knowledge of JavaScript arrays and functions.
